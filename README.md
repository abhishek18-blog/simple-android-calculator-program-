Simple Android Calculator (Java)

A sleek, dark-themed Android calculator application built using Java and XML. This project demonstrates fundamental Android development concepts, including UI layout design, event handling, and basic arithmetic logic.

🚀 Features

Basic Arithmetic: Supports Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.

Smart UI: Features a modern "Dark Mode" aesthetic with custom backgroundTint button styling.

Error Handling: Includes logic to prevent "Division by Zero" errors.

Clean Formatting: Automatically formats results to hide unnecessary decimals (e.g., shows 5 instead of 5.0).

Display Logic: Uses EditText for input and a dedicated TextView for displaying final results.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Java

Layout: XML (RelativeLayout)

IDE: Android Studio

Min SDK: 24+

Event Listeners: Using View.OnClickListener to capture user input.

State Management: Using boolean flags (isAddition, isMultiply) to track operations across different inputs.

UI Design: Organizing elements using RelativeLayout and android:layout_toEndOf properties.
